## Predicting MLB Baseball Game Outcomes

When he immigrated to the U.S., my dad decided to make life just a little harder on himself by becoming none other than... a Mets fan. Let me tell you - being raised by a Mets fan is not so easy. No matter how many good things have happened that day, if the Mets lose, my dad is in a bad mood.

Which led me to a project idea... what if I could build a model that could predict MLB Baseball game outcomes? This way, maybe I can predict my dad's mood, and know when would be a good time to reach out, and when may be a good time to stand clear of his way.

This model may also help with baseball betting, should I want to get into that and bring in some additional $. 

**Project Goal.** 
Build a Classifier for MLB baseball games.

**The Data.**
Data was collected from the Sportsradar API.

**The Model & Metrics.**
To measure the quality of my classifier, I translated 
The XGBoost Classifier worked the best, providing an Accuracy score of 58%, about 6% more than what a baseball game better would need to break even. If I had used this model to bet on the 2019 Baseball Season, I would have achieved a 33% ROI with a $8600 investment on games that scored high model prediction certainty.
